learnt in the class to style the page and get it as close to the design as possible
Visual - Color, Background Color, Font family
Dimensional - Width, height, padding, margin
Alignment - Display - block, inline, inline-block

JS
For the problems given in the previous assignment, use all the language tools we've
learnt (variables, data types(primitive and non-primitive), loops) to try and solve
the problem (this will be further taken up in the class as well, just give it a
shot)

1. Find the square of a given number
var x,y;   //Declare variables x and y
x=3;       //store given number to variable x
y=x*x;     //do multiplication by same number and store output to var y
console.log(y)

2. Look at the time of the day and tell whether it's time for breakfast, lunch or
dinner
var hr=9;                   //get time from system clock in 24 hr format
if(hr>=5 && hr<=10){
console.log("Breakfast");   //If hr value is in between of 5-10 display "Breakfast"
}
else if(hr>=11 && hr<=14){  //if hr value is in between of 11-14 display "Lunch"
console.log("Lunch");  
}  
else if(hr>=19 && hr<=22){
console.log("Dinner");       //if hr value is in between of 19-22 display "Dinner"
}
else{
console.log("not time for food");       //else display "not time for food"
}

3. Given a number, find whether the number is odd or even
var x=2;      //Get number that number store in variable
if(x%2==1){   //devide that variable by 2
console.log("odd number"); //If result has remainder then display "odd number"
}  
else{
console.log("even number");  //else display "even number"
}
4. Find out whether a given number or a string is palindrome(something that looks
the same reading straight or in reverse)
var x="ab",y;
  if(typeof x=="number"){
      y=x.toString().split('').reverse().join('');
      y=parseInt(y);
      if(x===y){
          console.log("Palindrom number");
      }
      else{
        console.log("not Palindrom number");
      }
  }
  else{
    y=x.split('').reverse().join('');
    if(x==y){
      console.log("Palindrom string");
    }
    else{
      console.log("not Palindrom string");
    }
  }

5. Find the 10th number of a fibonacci series(research about this)
  var x=0,y=1,counter=3,z;  //Initialize two variables x,y,counter and store value 0,1,3 in both variables accordingly, declare z and counter variable
  console.log(x,y);  //display value of x,y variables
  for(counter=3;counter<=9;counter++){  //Loop until counter = 9
  z=x+y;
  console.log(z);
  x=y;y=z;
  }
