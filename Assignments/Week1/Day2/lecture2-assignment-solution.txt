JS
For the following problems, please breakdown and give precise instructions as to
how would you go about telling a computer to solve the problem, give as much
details as possible
1. Find the square of a given number
  -Declare variables x and y | var x,y;
  -store given number to variable x  | x=3;
  -do multiplication by same number and store output to var y | y=x*x;
  -display value of variable y | console.log(y)

2. Look at the time of the day and tell whether it's time for breakfast, lunch or
dinner
  -get time from system clock in 24 hr format
  -If hr value is in between of 5-10 display "Breakfast"
  -if hr value is in between of 11-14 display "Lunch"
  -if hr value is in between of 19-22 display "Dinner"
  -else display "not time for food"

3. Given a number, find whether the number is odd or even
  -Get number that number store in variable
  -devide that variable by 2
  -If result has remainder then display "odd number"
  -else display "even number"

4. Find out whether a given number or a string is palindrome(something that looks
the same reading straight or in reverse)
  -store given number or sting to variable
  -reverse that number or string and store it into another variable
  -compare both value of both variable
  -If value match then display "palindrome"
  -else display "not palindrome"

5. Find the 10th number of a fibonacci series(research about this)
  -Initialize two variables x,y,counter and store value 0,1,3 in both variables accordingly, declare z and counter variable
  -display value of x,y variables
  -Loop until counter = 9
	x + y = z;
	display z;
	initialize x=y; y=z;
	counter++;
